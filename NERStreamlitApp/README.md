# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Streamlit App

This interactive web app lets users explore and customize **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Built for experimentation and education, it supports rule-based entity recognition through spaCy's `EntityRuler` and interactive visualizations.

## Project Overview

**NER** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that automatically identifies and classifies named entitiesâ€”such as people, organizations, locations, or dates, in text.  
This app enhances NER by allowing users to:

- Upload their own text or enter it manually
- Add **custom entities and rules** (e.g., "PRODUCT: MFST, interest rates")
- Visualize results using spaCyâ€™s DisplaCy
- Export data for further analysis

This NER application is ideal for finance, journalism, academic research, or anyone curious regarding NER workflows.

## App Features

- **Text Input**: Upload `.txt` files or type/paste text directly
- **Add Custom Entity Rules**: Define entity `label` and `pattern` using spaCy-compatible syntax
- **Entity Filtering**: Select which entity types to display (e.g., only `ORG`, `DATE`)
- **Frequency Chart**: View entity distribution with an interactive bar chart
- **Entity Visualization**: See highlighted entities using spaCyâ€™s DisplaCy
- **Export Options**:  
   - Download extracted entities as CSV  
   - Export your custom rules as a JSON pattern file

### Example Pattern

```json
{"label": "TICKER", "pattern": "MFST"}
{"label": "FIN_TERM", "pattern": "interest rates"}
```
