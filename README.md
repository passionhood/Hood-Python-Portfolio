## Streamlit App for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
View Project Repository - https://github.com/passionhood/Hood-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp

This real-time interactive web app project employs Streamlit and spaCy to enable users to experiment with Named Entity Recognition (NER) in real-time. Users can input their own text, define rule-based entity labels using spaCy's EntityRuler, and view the entities graphically highlighted with dynamic highlighting.

The app has both manual text input and.txt file upload capabilities, so it is usable by both technical and non-technical users. It also has a JSON export option for custom NER rules.

How it fits in my portfolio:
This project showcases my skills in:
- Creating and deploying interactive NLP tools
- Integrating rule-based AI models with user interfaces
- Handling real-time text processing and visualization
- Mapping complex machine learning tasks to user-friendly web apps

It complements my portfolio by drawing attention to experience with hands-on natural language processing and full-stack Python application developmentâ€”suitable skills in AI product careers, data science, and digital humanities applications.
