This interactive web application using Streamlit and spaCy provides the functionality for users to experiment with Named Entity Recognition (NER) in real-time. Users can input their own text, define rule-based entity labels with spaCy's EntityRuler, and view the entities highlighted dynamically in a minimalistic user interface.

The app includes both manual typing and uploading from.txt file, and therefore it can be used by technical as well as non-technical users. It also supports export of JSON so that users are able to save their personal NER rules.

## How it contributes to my portfolio:
This project showcases my strength in:
- Developing and hosting interactive NLP applications
- Blending rule-based AI models and user interfaces
- Handling real-time text processing and visualization
- Translating complex machine learning procedures into usable web applications

It complements my portfolio by indicating hands-on natural language processing and full-stack Python programming.
