New Project: Tidy Data & Federal R&D Spending Analysis
Repository: Tidy Data Project, 

This project is all about cleaning, reshaping, and analyzing federal R&D spending data with Pandas and Tidy Data Principles.

Project Highlights:
✔ Repurposed unstructured financial data into a shape with .melt() and .split().
✔ Visualized spending patterns with Matplotlib and Seaborn for analysis.
✔ Utilized pivot tables to aggregate budget trends by various years and departments.

This project showcases my ability to clean and analyze real finance datasets, which is an essential skill in data science and quantitative finance. This project contributes a strength to my portfolio by emphasizing data wrangling, organizing, and visualization techniques that are essential tools in financial analysis.
