# üìÇ Hood Python Portfolio

Welcome to my Python project portfolio! This repository houses a collection of hands-on, interdisciplinary projects that showcase my skills in **data science**, **finance**, **natural language processing**, and **interactive app development**. Each project emphasizes real-world problem-solving through clean code, effective data handling, and meaningful user interaction.

## üîó Featured Streamlit Applications

### üìà [Investment Portfolio Analyzer (StreamlitAppFinal)](https://github.com/passionhood/Hood-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/PortfolioAnalyzer)

> **Live App**: *Coming soon*

This app allows users to upload a CSV file of their current stock holdings and receive a detailed, interactive portfolio analysis. It calculates:
- **Portfolio returns**, **volatility**, and **Sharpe Ratio**
- **Asset allocation** visualizations
- **Performance comparison** against the S&P 500

**Why It Matters**  
This project demonstrates my ability to work with financial data and develop professional-grade tools for real-time investment analysis‚Äîan area that aligns directly with my interests in **quantitative finance** and **data-driven decision-making**. It integrates Python programming, data wrangling, visualization, and Streamlit deployment.

### üß† [NER Streamlit App](https://github.com/passionhood/Hood-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)  
üîó [Live App](https://hood-python-portfolio-chfnvfg4lpz5zora763kvf.streamlit.app/)

An interactive NLP application that lets users:
- Input or upload text files
- Define custom named entity rules with spaCy‚Äôs `EntityRuler`
- Visualize entity types using DisplaCy
- Export entity rules as a reusable JSON file

**Why It Matters**  
This app complements my portfolio by showcasing my knowledge in **natural language processing**, **rule-based modeling**, and the **deployment of user-friendly machine learning tools**. It reflects a key technical interest: making AI more interpretable and accessible to non-technical users.

## üìä [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/passionhood/Hood-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project-main)

- Cleaned and restructured messy U.S. federal R&D budget data
- Used Pandas‚Äô `.melt()` and `.pivot_table()` to reformat and analyze spending trends
- Visualized results using Seaborn and Matplotlib

**Why It Matters**  
This project highlights my foundational data wrangling skills and attention to reproducibility and structure‚Äîkey for roles in analytics, policy, and data science.
